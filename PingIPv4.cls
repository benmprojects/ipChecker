'Simple "ping by IPv4 address" class.
'
'Method Ping() returns:
'
'   True  --> Success
'   False --> Failure
'
'Extended info is exposed via RoundTripTime, Reason, and Status
'properties.
'
'A helper method Resolve() is also provided.  It can be passed a name
'or IP string and get back the IP string to use in calling Ping().
'
'   If you do not need name resolution you can delete Resolve() and its
'   related declarations to save on program size.
'
'   If you want to loop calling Ping() several times call Resolve() once
'   and reuse its output.  This is less costly than repeatedly calling
'   Resolve().
'
'-------
'Status:
'-------
'
'Status may contain system error numbers or IP_STATUSES values.
'
'Description strings are not provided here at runtime to save on program
'size since they are seldom required but you could create a message
'lookup function to convert values to descriptions if you have the need.
